It's really easy to make with almost no effort and it tastes really great.
This dish is often made in the Mediterranean area and uses a lot of tomatoes.
I've adapted the recipe, so it probably doesn't come close to an original, but it's still really good.

## Ingredients

As always, the ingredients are for 1 person so you can multiply them easily!

- 1 onion
- 1 red bell pepper
- 200 grammes of canned tomatoes
- 1 egg
- A couple of spoons of (Greek) yogurt
- Grated cheese
- Some Mediterranean bread if you like

Spices and stuff:

- (Yellow) curry powder
- Cilantro
- Parsley
- Garlic
- Salt
- Olive oil

## How to make

1. Cut the onion and bell pepper into small pieces
2. Add olive oil to a medium heat pan
3. Add the onion and bell pepper to the pan and fry until they're soft
4. Add the canned tomatoes
5. Add the curry powder, cilantro, parsley, garlic, and salt
6. Mix everything together very well
7. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes
8. Crack the eggs into the pan on top of the tomato mixture
9. When the eggs become slightly solid, add the grated cheese
10. Serve with some yogurt and Mediterranean bread
