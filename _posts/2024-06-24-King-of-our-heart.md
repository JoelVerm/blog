# King of our heart

These are an English version of the lyrics for the song ["Koning van ons hart" by Zeal Worship](https://open.spotify.com/track/0qPHmtqDzts88zL75Lv8To?si=f35a9f6b3aed409e)

I just made them because I love the song and I want to share them with you.

## The lyrics

The darkness flees, it's a new day\
when Jesus takes our sin away\
He is our Saviour day and night

By the power of Gods lead\
He's our Redeemer, we're complete\
Never alone in our fight

You are here\
in between us,\
You are here\
and never let us go

> Chorus:
>
> You are the King of our heart\
> Your truthful wisdom lights our path\
> and so we thank and praise you Lord
>
> I sing for you my Source of life\
> straight through the blackest, darkest night\
> and so we thank and praise you Lord

Every day

♫

By His death, high and alone,\
He restored and brought us home\
He is our Saviour day and night

We are free in Jesus name\
because His power overcame\
Yes He has saved us in our fight

You are here\
in between us,\
You are here\
and never let us go

`Chorus`

Every day

♫

> In Your word\
> I find the power\
> I need to stand
>
> Your spirit fills\
> us with His courage\
> till the end

2x

`Chorus 2x`

Every day
